# Spotify Clone (Re-design)

This project is based off of the awesome spotify redesign by Nicholas Ergemla 
You can find his design on dribbble at https://dribbble.com/shots/15165960-Spotify-Redesign

## Why This Project?
For this project I wanted to get a little more practice by drilling the basics of front-end development. Pushing my html and css skills a little further. As a beginner in web development I found myself jumping from one project to another trying to create these kind of amazing projects and they never really come together as I picture them 😅

This one was also to be a project for my portfolio. Proving my ability to turn design to actual code. Although it could be cleaner. 😏

## What Did I Use?

I tried using some Sass for this project. Given that I've never actually used sass before, I learned it as I was coding along this project and as a result the style.scss is nothing short of a whole mess. Terrible practice not splitting up the file too🙈 

Otherwise Its just plain html markup and styling. I have not added any functionality at all.
